- fix image features
- compute explanation recall against actual oracle (rather than LIME explanations thereof)
- track trustability wrt randomly selected features
- track initial and final learner explanations
- display oracle explanations
- look at classical datasets used in active learning (esp. for comparison with
  baselines and non-kernel-based models)
- implement Chernoff image dataset? (100 images, must be labelled manually)
